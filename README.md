# SPM_Software_Complexity_SPM_WE_28

This is the Project on Software Complexity Measurement which was done for Software Project Management Module in 3rd year 2nd semester.

Main objective of this tool is to measure the complexity of the given Java or C++ program.

This tool measures the complexity based on the following factors.

1). Size tokens
2). Control Structures
3). Nested Structures
4). Inheritance Count
5). Recursion Count

To facilitate the process of measuring the software complexity, we came up with the following functionalities as well.

•	Upload C++, Java Program Files to measure complexity.
•	Checking the syntactical correctness of the programs.
•	Keeping Track of Past Program Complexity Measurements.
•	Comparing the complexities among different programs.
•	Define complexity measuring metrices to be used.
